Fetaures covered in code base
------------
------------
1. Unittest addeed for each of the functions implemented
2. Gitlab ci/cd for step to step code building
3. Custom exception added
4. Used isort, black and pylint to make necessary pep-8 recommended code changes
5. Used coverage tool to test code coverage of the modules used

Things can be improved
------------
------------
1. CI/CD can be used to build the code package using python wheels.
2. Code coverage tool can be further used to restrict building the package if unit test or lint are not as per configured values.
3. More command line functions can be added to provide input to the functions and export output to the respective sources to scale this app for larger use case
